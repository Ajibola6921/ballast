/**
 * Drives a repo through a margin call, a cure, and a default, with only the services acting once
 * the terms are set. Real prices do not fall on demand, so the call is created by tightening the
 * repo's margin thresholds under the trade's real LTV (as the liquidation drill does for credit
 * lines), and the cure window is shortened so the default can be reached in minutes.
 *
 *  1. lender proposes, borrower accepts: 100 RWA1 for 50 TUSD
 *  2. thresholds are tightened under the real LTV -> services/keeper opens a margin call
 *  3. the borrower adds collateral through the API -> the contract clears the call
 *  4. thresholds are tightened again, under the new LTV -> a second call opens
 *  5. the borrower does nothing; once the cure window ends the keeper defaults the trade: the
 *     lender receives just the units that cover what is owed and the rest goes back to the borrower
 *
 * Run via `scripts/e2e-repo-margin.sh`, which restores the thresholds and the cure window on exit.
 * Needs `KEEPER_REPO_MARGIN_CRON` set to every minute (dev-setup.sh does) or it will be slow.

# services/margin-monitor

Polling worker that watches every open credit line and records when its margin state changes. It has no
HTTP surface and sends no transactions, so it needs no operator key.

Every poll it selects `credit_line` rows with status `open` and an on-chain `contract_line_id`, and for each
one calls `CreditLine.ltv` (a read-only simulation). The LTV and state (`Healthy`, `Warning`, `MarginCall`,
`Liquidation`, as the contract defines them) always come from the contract, never from off-chain arithmetic,
so they match what a real liquidation would use. The result is compared with the line's latest
`margin_event`; a line with no prior event counts as `Healthy`.

On a change it inserts a `margin_event` (`from_state`, `to_state`, `ltv_bps`, and the newest `price_snapshot`
for the first pledged asset of the line, if any) and logs it. Moving to `MarginCall` or `Liquidation` also
fires a `margin_call` alert. An unchanged state writes nothing. A failure on one line is logged and the
other lines are still checked.

## How it connects to the rest

- `services/api` has a webhook outbox that scans new `margin_event` rows and enqueues deliveries to
  subscribers. This service does not call the API.
- `services/keeper`'s `cure-expiry` job reads the latest `margin_event` to decide which lines to poke and
  liquidate, and counts the cure window from these rows' timestamps. This service never liquidates.
- `services/price-guard` writes the `price_snapshot` rows referenced by `margin_event`.

## Run

```
pnpm dev                                          # from the repo root, with every other service
pnpm --filter @ballast/service-margin-monitor dev # this service only (tsx watch)
pnpm --filter @ballast/service-margin-monitor build && pnpm --filter @ballast/service-margin-monitor start
```

The repo-root `.env` is loaded automatically.

## Environment

- `DATABASE_URL`: Postgres.
- `STELLAR_NETWORK`, `STELLAR_RPC_URL`, `STELLAR_HORIZON_URL`, `STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`: network.
- `STELLAR_SIMULATION_SOURCE`: funded account the `ltv` simulation runs as. Required; it never signs.
- `CREDIT_LINE_CONTRACT_ID`: required; startup fails without it.
- `MARGIN_MONITOR_POLL_MS`: pause between polls, default `15000`. The next poll starts after the previous
  one finishes plus this pause.
- `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`, `ALERT_COOLDOWN_S`: optional delivery of the `margin_call` alert; it is always logged.

## Source map

- `src/index.ts`: startup, the polling loop, per-line error handling.
- `src/monitor.ts`: `recomputeLine`, the read, compare and record step.

## Tests

`pnpm --filter @ballast/service-margin-monitor test` (vitest). `monitor.test.ts` uses a stubbed database
query chain, a stubbed `CreditLineClient` and a spy alerter. It covers: no write when the state is
unchanged; a `margin_event` plus alert on the move to `MarginCall`; a first event treated as coming from
`Healthy`. The polling loop in `index.ts` is not covered. Test doubles live only in `*.test.ts`; `src` has
no mock data.

## Does not

- Subscribe to price updates or chain events: it polls, so a state change is seen up to one interval late
  (a code comment calls polling a stand-in until the indexer's `chain_event` stream can drive it).
- Record a repeat of the same state, or distinguish a changed LTV within a state.
- Check repo trades: repo margin is handled by `services/keeper`'s `repo-margin` job.
- Send webhooks or call `liquidate`.

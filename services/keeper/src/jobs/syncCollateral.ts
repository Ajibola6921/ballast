/**
 * Reconciles each open line's collateral figure on `CreditLine` with what `PledgeVault` actually
 * holds for it.
 *
 * The vault reports every change to a position to the credit line in the same transaction
 * (`CreditLine::sync_from_vault`), so a healthy deployment never needs this job to change anything.
 * It exists to repair drift: a line that predates the vault wiring, a vault reconfigured after
 * positions existed, anything that left the two out of step. The vault's own balance is the source
 * of truth. This job never derives the figure from Postgres: our pledge rows can lag a transaction
 * by a sweep interval, and syncing from them would briefly write back a collateral number that no
 * longer exists, reopening the release-then-draw window the vault reporting closes.
 *
 * A line already in step costs two reads and no transaction, which is what lets this run every
 * minute without paying a fee per line per run.
